# Test Driven Development For Spring Boot Based Microservices
Import the project into any IDE as maven project.

There are totally 3 types of api driven microservice applications:
- Products Service
- Review Service
- Inventory Service

Tests are segregated per service. If you want to run all the tests in the project, run the below command from the project folder.
```
mvn clean test
```

You can run each individual test by opening the IDE, right click on each individual test and run it.
